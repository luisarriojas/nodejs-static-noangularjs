Static website without AngularJS using Node.js

### How to use:
1) Modify the Router section on index.js.
2) Add files to the folder's structure of your choice.

This boilerplate comes with:
* A "static" folder to store .html files.
* A "css" folder to store .css files.
* An "img" folder to store .jpg files.
* You can create a "js" folder to store .js files or whatever you want to do.
